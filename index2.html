<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>This project explores mathematical topics commonly found in systems science and engineer- ing and electrical engineering, and applies them to analyzing financial instruments. Topics explored include moving averages, Kalman Filtering, Linear Model, Wiener Filtering, and dithering. Fundamental ideas from each topic were modified to analyze financial instru- ments and ultimately assess how each might be useful for devising an automated trading strategy. Each topic was implemented in Python and uses the NumPy and SciPy libraries for advanced computation. Results show that some of the filters provide good insight at a very fundamental implementation, and when put into more advanced programs, may be extremely successful.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<hr />

<p>In 2009, it was estimated that quantitative trading firms, which represented 2% of the number of trading firms operating in US markets, accounted for around 70% of all equity trading volume [key-2]. Although this number has since decreased, it demonstrates the extraordinary growth in quantitative finance that was experienced in the last decade.</p>

<p>Such fast paced growth was facilitated by major advancements in communications systems that took place in parallel. Computers have vastly decreased communication times and eliminated much of the simple arbitrage that existed since the inception of the capital markets.</p>

<p>Many orders placed by these firms are executed with pre-programmed electronic instructions that are designed by mathematically inclined traders. The content of these instructions is a highly guarded secret within each firm, and it's often the case that an algorithm has a limited lifetime where it is able to take advantage of discovered arbitrage opportunities before the markets adjust or other firms develop similar strategies and the opportunity is minimized [key-3].</p>

<p>This project is concerned with how topics in systems science and electrical engineering may be applied to this industry. Many topics such as control theory, signal processing and optimization are relevant to high frequency trading. Engineers who study systems science often seek to discover the signal through the noise or optimize a constrained mathematical model. Similarly, traders seek to optimize their portfolios and discover arbitrage opportunities.</p>

<h3>Problem Statement</h3>

<p>Analyze the effectiveness of various systems science and electrical engineering prediction methods in tracking the price of financial instruments in the stock market.</p>

<h2>Experiment Overview</h2>

<hr>

<h3>Application of Systems Science and Electrical Engineering Topics</h3>

<p>In this paper, we explore the following systems science and electrical engineering topics:</p>

<p><strong>Double Moving Average</strong></p>

<p>The double moving average algorithm is a widely known, simple example of an algorithmic trading strategy. It works by trading an equity when its short and long moving averages cross, thereby indicating momentum.</p>

<p><strong>Wiener Filter</strong></p>

<p>The wiener filter is an algorithm that seeks to filter out noise in order to estimate the true underlying signal. The method assumes the signal is a linear stochastic process with known autocorrelation and seeks to minimize the error between the actual signal and its measurements.</p>

<p><strong>The Kalman Filter</strong></p>

<p>The Kalman Filter is a recursive algorithm that uses measurements observed over time to predict the value of future measurements. It has been proven to be an effective estimator for many real world applications. However, the Kalman Filter requires a mathematical model for the system it tracks. In this project we implement a simplified version of the Kalman Filter called the Alpha-Beta-Gamma Filter, which does not require a rigorous mathematical model.</p>

<p><strong>Linear Prediction Model</strong></p>

<p>In this project, a linear prediction model is used to estimate future financial instrument prices by training on recent historical data. This model works by using 1000 historical data points to predict 1 future point.</p>

<p><strong>Trading Simulation</strong></p>

<p>For this project, we constructed a trading simulator in Python, a highly versatile dynamically typed programming language. We define a Trade Algorithm as the highest level object in the simulation. Each Trade Algorithm is initialized with an estimator type, price history for a single financial instrument and an empty Portfolio Object with $100,000 of starting capital. Then the simulation is run over the price history, making trades based on the projected price in the following time step.</p>

<h3>List of Simulation Data Structures</h3>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>TradeAlgorithm</strong>:  Top level controller for the trading simulation, executes the trading strategy.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Portfolio</strong>:  Maintains current available capital and a list of assets.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Asset</strong>:  An object unique to each financial instrument that maintains how many units are owned in the Portfolio.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Order</strong>:  A small data structure to facilitate transactions.</p></li>
</ul>


<h3>Summarized Simulation Procedure</h3>

<ol>
<li><p>Initialize TradeAlgorithm with price history and algorithm type.</p></li>
<li><p>Iterate over the price history.</p></li>
<li><p>Note the current price and calculate the projected price using one of the estimators.</p></li>
<li><p>If the projected price is greater than the current price, place a “BUY” order for 1 unit at the current price. If the projected price is less than the current price, place a “SELL” order at the current price.</p></li>
<li><p>Once the all of the data has been processed, sell all remaining assets at the last noted price.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2>Double Moving Average</h2>

<hr />

<h3>3.1 Theory</h3>

<p>A moving average is an average taken from a subset of a time-series of data. It is calculated between the current time and a predetermined window going j steps back. As time advances, this average changes as the subset adds more current values and removes older ones. A plot of the moving average over time can reveal some valuable insight regarding the long term performance of a financial instrument as opposed to the small random fluctuations observed on a step-by-step basis. Moving averages have been used to analyze financial instruments for quite some time, with a common method being the double moving average.
For a double moving average algorithm, there are two windows of different sizes. Comparing the difference between the two averages indicates not only the long term performance of the instrument, but it can affectively provide a prediction as to how that instrument will perform. If an instrument started increasing in value, the shorter window would increase at a rate faster than the longer window as there are fewer samples to consider. Knowing this, a simple algorithm can be written to buy a financial instrument whenever the shorter window crosses and becomes greater than the longer window; in the opposite situation, the algorithm would sell.</p>

<p>The concepts used in this algorithm may be basic, but they have proven to be successful and are widely popular in quantitative finance. Although it is not a topic practically seen in systems science or electrical engineering, this algorithm is still worth exploring and will also be great for comparison.</p>

<h3>3.2 Design</h3>

<p>Implementing the moving average is extremely simple. The algorithm has inputs of long and short windows (Wl and Ws ]), and it continually calculates each moving average as time progresses. Since a trade decision is only made if the moving averages cross, only the averages from the previous step need to be stored in memory. The program calculates the difference between the averages (Wl − Ws ), and if the previous difference was positive and the current is negative, a buy will be ordered. A sell will be ordered under the opposite conditions; nothing occurs under consistent conditions.</p>

<h3>3.3 Results</h3>

<h4>3.3.1 Trading Simulation Specifications</h4>

<p>Data Equity price history
Period/Freq 1 year at 10 minute resolution. ~9000 data points per equity
Stocks Ford (F), Apple (AAPL), Accenture (ACN), Caterpillar (CAT), Macy’s (M), United Parcel Service (UPS), Priceline (PCLN), Campbell Soup Company (CPB)
Starting-capital $100,000 (Ci)
Wl 50, 200 steps
Ws 25, 100 steps
Many window sizes were initially explored, but the (Wl, Ws) combinations of (25, 50) and (100, 200) consistently showed the most promising results.</p>

<h4>3.3.2 Net Profit</h4>

<p>Net profit is calculated by taking the value of all cash and equity holdings (A) and subtracting the starting capital ($100,000).</p>

<p>P = A − Ci</p>

<p>The following graphs are comparisons between the net profit achieved by running the Double
Moving Averages algorithm on the two different window sets, (25, 50) and (100, 200).</p>

<p>Graph of Net Profit where (Wl, Ws) = (25, 50)</p>

<p>Figure 3.1: Net Profit Realized in Simulation with (Wl, Ws) = (25, 50)
￼
The only notable success came from AAPL, which gave a return of $245.38. CAT also had a small gain of $15.99. The other stocks all lost a small amount, the most being PCLN at $25.33. Total returns on each of these stocks were $208.81, mostly due to the success from AAPL.</p>

<p>Graph of Total Net Returns where (Wl, Ws) = (100, 200)</p>

<p>Figure 3.2: Net Profit Realized in Simulation with (Wl, Ws) = (100, 200)</p>

<p>Again, AAPL performed well, but not the same performance seen previously as returns shrank to $104.95. CAT also had a smaller gain of $8.51. The other stocks again lost a small amount, except PCLN now lost $98.31. Total returns on each of these stocks were -$20.12; AAPL and PCLN offset each other and the slight losses from the others added up.</p>

<h3>3.4 Evaluation</h3>

<h4>3.4.1 Choice of (Wl, Ws)</h4>

<p>Choosing the length of each window is critical to the outcome of each simulation. In addition to the shown simulations of (25, 50) and (100, 200), simulations were done with windows at shorter and longer ranges as well as at different proportions. At a glance, these two achieved the best results, and coincidentally both have a short to long window ratio of 1 : 2. Windows set to a very short distance performed very poorly, while very long lengths were only slightly worse than the ones used.</p>

<h4>3.4.2 Conclusions</h4>

<p>The Double Moving Average algorithm shows some promising signs, but at its fundamental implementation, it is not something that can consistently make for a good strategy. However, a more thorough implementation could show dramatic improvements. Using windows of very short length make the calculations change much more quickly, which causes the algorithm to make more aggressive, sometimes stupid decisions. A very long window can make it slow to react to important changes. Windows of medium length showed the best results.</p>
